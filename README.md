## Insights

This data shows how Bollywood grew from almost nothing in the 1930s to a massive film-producing machine by the 2010s, where releases hit their highest point. Certain collaborations shaped the industry—like David Dhawan with Govinda or Akshay Kumar’s frequent pair-ups—which shows how much star chemistry drives Bollywood filmmaking. The top actor and director counts highlight who dominated different eras, while the genre chart makes it clear that drama, romance, and action have always carried the bulk of storytelling energy.
